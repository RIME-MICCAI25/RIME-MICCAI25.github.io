      <h1>Welcome to the Reconstruction and Imaging Motion Estimation workshop</h1>
      <p>Advances in medical imaging have revolutionized healthcare, offering detailed insights into anatomical and functional processes. However, accurate image reconstruction and motion estimation remain critical challenges, particularly in dynamic and real-time imaging. This workshop focuses on the intersection of reconstruction and motion estimation, exploring their pivotal roles in enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and speed of medical imaging modalities.
We aim to foster discussions on a wide range of topics, including computational methods for image reconstruction, innovations in machine learning, and model-based and data-driven approaches for motion estimation and compensation. Special emphasis will be placed on synergistic frameworks that integrate reconstruction and motion estimation tasks, as well as translational research highlighting clinical applications.
By bringing together researchers, clinicians, and industry experts, this workshop seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and clinical practice, promote collaboration, and inspire the next generation of innovators in medical imaging.</p>
